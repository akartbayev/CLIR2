============== The allocated time for this project is 48 hours. ==============

Hour 1-2. Begin reading Koehn chapter 6. -
http://langtech.github.com/clir/materials/koehn-06.pdf
Forked clir repository, shared it with team members. Uploaded team members
project 1 files as a reference for all.

Hour 3. Spent in tutorial. Discussed with team about the requirements for
next Wednesday's presentation. These requirements include: Setting up a work
plan, establishing project milestones, how we are going to utilise existing
resources (such as using tools to generate the required models:
translation/langauge/reordering) setting up team member responsibilities and
ensuring that we can present a progress report.

Hour 4. Brainstorming an appopriate data structure that can be used for
storing 'hypotheses' as mentioned in the aforementioned Koehn paper. Continued
reading Koehn paper up until section 6.4. Will revisit this when implementing
optimisations. 

Hour 5-6. Spent in the workshop. Programmatically constructing the data
structure for the hypothesis with Hai. An Hypothesis will be a class, allowing
the attributes: translation, partial score and a pointer to the previous
hypothesis. Have to work on processing the phrase table output generated from
project 1.

Hour 7-10. Been a while since I've worked on this project due to exams, just
reading through notes and refreshing my mind on key topics, reading through
the phrase paper once again, and re-understanding the code from the previous
project.
